# Challenge

I completed this challenege using pyspark. In 2 hours I could complete step 1 and two questions out of three in step 2. 
I couldn't complete one of the questions as I ran out of time.
code: weather_challenge.py ( outside "code" folder)

I took a couple of hours more to complete the challenge and I did my best. I was initillay running the scripts in REPL. 
For the latter one, I created a python file, log file and output files.
weather_challenge.py inside the "code" folder is the completed one. I have also uploaded the log and output files.
